# Drowsiness_Detector
The test.py was an initial version that only has the number of frames when a person blinks. 

drowsiness.py is the actual final version which has the entire code for the number of times a person blinks and the number of frames their eyes were closed for. 
This can be used in conjunction with many things such as hardware, as software extensions etc. do find out is a person is sleepy. 

Future updates to this that we have planned up until now are adding a feature that can calculate for how long was one blink in seconds rather than frames. This would be much more useful as we believe it is quite intuitive that the longer a person blinks for, the lesser times they'd have to blink. Thus, combining both parameters of how many times a person blinked and the duration for longer blinks would be much more accurate and useable.
